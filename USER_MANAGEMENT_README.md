3. Save the file

### Option 2: Edit JSON directly
1. Open `Data/simplified_users.json` in a text editor
2. Find a user and update their custom fields:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "5115246465138688",
     "display_name": "Adam Williamson",
     "email": "adaadwil@iu.edu",
     "team": "Service Desk",
     "manager": "John Smith",
     "shift": "day",
     "priority_level": "high",
     "skills": "Windows, Linux, Network Troubleshooting",
     "backup_contact": "jane.doe@iu.edu",
     "notes": "Team lead for service desk operations"
   }
   ```

## Usage Examples

### View specific user
```bash
python3 view_simplified_users.py --user-id "5115246465138688"
```

### Filter by team (after you've added team data)
```bash
python3 view_simplified_users.py --team "Service Desk"
```

### Filter by manager (after you've added manager data)
```bash
python3 view_simplified_users.py --manager "John Smith"
```

### List all teams
```bash
python3 view_simplified_users.py --list-teams
```

### List all managers
```bash
python3 view_simplified_users.py --list-managers
```

## Integration with Status Reports

You can enhance your status reports to include custom variables by modifying the existing scripts to read from the simplified user files. This allows you to:

- Group employees by team in status reports
- Show manager information for escalation
- Filter by shift for operational planning
- Display priority levels for critical personnel
- Include skills for specialized issue routing

## Refreshing Data

When you need to update user data (new employees, changed info), simply run:
```bash
python3 "User Status/fetch_users.py"
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Fetch the latest user data from Dialpad API
- ‚úÖ Update the main users.json cache  
- ‚úÖ Automatically update simplified user files
- ‚úÖ **Preserve all your custom data** while adding new users
- ‚úÖ Show you exactly what was updated

### Smart Merging
The enhanced fetch script uses smart merging:
- **New users**: Added with empty custom fields for you to fill
- **Existing users**: Custom data preserved, API data updated
- **Removed users**: Not automatically deleted (manual cleanup if needed)

### Skip Simplified Files
If you only want to update the main cache:
```bash
python3 "User Status/fetch_users.py" --skip-simplified
```

## Tips

1. **Start Small**: Add one custom field at a time (like 'team') before expanding
2. **Use Consistent Values**: For fields like 'shift' or 'priority_level', use consistent values
3. **Backup Your Edits**: Keep a backup of your customized files before regenerating
4. **Excel Friendly**: The CSV format works great with Excel filters and sorting
5. **Version Control**: Consider adding these files to git to track changes over time
